# fractol
ractal renderer using minilibx  
Usage: fractol [multi] <set>  
  where <set> is one of Mandelbrot/burning-ship/tricorn.  
  [multi] enables adjusting the power to which the fractal is calculated (=multibrot variants)  
  all fractal sets can be switched to their corresponding Julia sets, where the set is calculated for the current coordinates of the cursor.  
Includes Mandelbrot/tricorn/burning-ship sets that can be adjusted to variable positive and negative powers and toggled to their corresponding Julia variants
